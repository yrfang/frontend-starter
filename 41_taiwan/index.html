      <h1>Hi, Formosa!</h1>

      <p>Taiwan, officially the Republic of
        China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbours include
        China (officially the People's Republic of China, PRC) to
        the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to
        the south.</p>

      <p>The island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa, was mainly
        inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines before the 17th century,
        when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island to Han
        Chinese immigration.</p>

      <p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid
        economic growth and industrialization, creating a stable
        industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it
        changed from a one-party military dictatorship dominated
        by the Kuomintang to a multi-party democracy with universal
        suffrage. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy in the world,
        and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global
        economy.</p>

      <p>It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, health
        care, public education, economic freedom, and human development.
        The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among
        the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the
        highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>
      <p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid blend of various sources,
        incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture, attributable
         to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its current
         residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
         increasingly Western values.</p>

      <p>One of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum,
        which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade,
        calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the
        greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.</p>
